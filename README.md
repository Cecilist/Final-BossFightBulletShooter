# Final Project

## Description
Made By: 
Jacob Cecil and Lucas Harris

A shoot-em-up game set in space. Your goal is to defeat the red eye square. There are 4 stages
to the fight, each one has the red eye square getting smaller and faster. 

You only take damage if the main part of your ship is hit. Bullets harmlessly fly over 
your wings.

### Controls: 
Arrow keys or WASD to move

Space(hold) to fire

## Project Report
For this iteration, we mainly focused on cleaning the project up and making the gameplay experience feel more rewarding.
Jacob focused on adding more boss patterns and making the boss fight more involved, instead of just requiring the player to hold space and dodge bullets.
Lucas spent the iteration cleaning up bugs and making the transitions between the different scenes more smooth, as well as adding more pop to the fight.
Overall, we are happy with our progress this iteration, though we fell into the same trap that we did the last 2 iterations with planning.
We set too many goals for ourselves, and we unfortunately didn't have time to get to everything we had planned.
Luckily, we prioritized the most important features, and we are happy with how this iteration turned out, even though we didn't get to everything we wanted to.
