## Project Report
Working on this project was a fun experience, although there were a few challenges.
Our schedules didn't really work for in-person meetings, so we were only ever able to meet in-person once.
To overcome this, we used Discord to discuss our plans, who would do what on the project, and to discuss possible additions.
We also had to make the most of our class time to work on fixing issues we couldn't figure out on our own.
The in-class work time was definitely beneficial, so we may try to meet up in-person more to make sure we can make good progress on fixing issues or implementing new features.
Being able to split up the work on the project was really helpful for both of us, as it allowed us to put more effort into our assigned features.
Overall, we are happy with how this iteration went, and we are excited to see how the next iterations turn out.
